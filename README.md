8) Enter your base url and the shared key into the runelite plugin

! Only share this link and Url and Key with people you trust, it's not my fault if your api gets leaked and PK'ers know your every move in the wilderness

## Updating Fork
1) Click the "Fetch Upstream" in your forked repository

2) If Heroku is setup correctly, the updated repository should automatically deploy on Heroku

!If this doesn't work, manually deploy the "master" branch
